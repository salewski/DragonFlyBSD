 * Quad arithmetic.
 *
 * This library makes the following assumptions:
 *
 *  - The type long long (aka quad_t) exists.
 *
 *  - A quad variable is exactly twice as long as `long'.
 *
 *  - The machine's arithmetic is two's complement.
 *
 * This library can provide 128-bit arithmetic on a machine with 128-bit
 * quads and 64-bit longs, for instance, or 96-bit arithmetic on machines
 * with 48-bit longs.
