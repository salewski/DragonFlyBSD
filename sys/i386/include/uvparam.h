 * Frequencies of the clock ticks reported by clock() and times().  They  
 * are the same as stathz for bogus historical reasons.  They should be
 * 1e6 because clock() and times() are implemented using getrusage() and
 * there is no good reason why they should be less accurate.  There is
 * the bad reason that (broken) programs might not like clock_t or
 * CLOCKS_PER_SEC being ``double'' (``unsigned long'' is not large enough
 * to hold the required 24 hours worth of ticks if the frequency is
 * 1000000ul, and ``unsigned long long'' would be nonstandard).
